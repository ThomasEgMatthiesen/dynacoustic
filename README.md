# Dynacoustic

This design prototype delves into the art of dynamic indoor acoustics, highlighting its capacity to elevate human experiences. It contrasts conventional static acoustic treatment approaches, advocating for adaptive, additive, and automated treatments that adapt to varying activities.

The interactive acoustic panel prototype exemplifies these principles. Users can manipulate sound absorption, integrate artificial reverb, and trigger automated adjustments based on factors such as time, light, and ambient sound levels.

The prototype underscores the possibilities of dynamic acoustics in a noise-focused world, prompting contemplation on its potential to enhance human engagement within indoor environments instead of muting auditory environments.
